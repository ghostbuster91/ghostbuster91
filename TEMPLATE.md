### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Kasper and I currently work at [SiriusXM](https://www.siriusxm.com/)

I am trying to make the software world a better place in a various ways including reporting bugs to oss libraries and fixing them. 

Nowadays, I mostly contribute to following ecosystems:
- neovim
- nix 
- scala

I am also a fan of mechanical keyboards. I have few, and I even built my own fork of Dilemma - https://github.com/ghostbuster91/Dilemma3x6_3

Feel free to reach me if you want to ask me about anything ðŸ™‚

#### Some nerd stats about me

Joined Github **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years ago.

Most of the time I'm creating software in these languages:
