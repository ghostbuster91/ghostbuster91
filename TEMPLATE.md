### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Kasper and I currently work at [Allegro](https://allegro.pl/)

I am trying to make the software world a better place in a various ways including reporting bugs to oss libraries and fixing them. I contributed to multiple projects during the recent time, to name a few:
- [tapir](https://github.com/softwaremill/tapir)
- [sttp](https://github.com/softwaremill/sttp)
- [diffx](https://github.com/softwaremill/diffx)
- [monix](https://github.com/monix/monix)
- [zio](https://github.com/zio/zio)
- [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)

Currently my main focus goes to [sttp-openapi-generator](https://github.com/ghostbuster91/sttp-openapi-generator)

Feel free to reach me if you want to ask me about anything ðŸ™‚
