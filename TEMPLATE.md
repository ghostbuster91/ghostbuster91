### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Kasper and I currently work at [IOHK](https://iohk.io/)

I am trying to make the software world a better place in a various ways including reporting bugs to oss libraries and fixing them. I contributed to multiple projects during the recent time, to name a few:
- [tapir](https://github.com/softwaremill/tapir)
- [sttp](https://github.com/softwaremill/sttp)
- [diffx](https://github.com/softwaremill/diffx)
- [monix](https://github.com/monix/monix)
- [zio](https://github.com/zio/zio)
- [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)

Feel free to reach me if you want to ask me about anything ðŸ™‚

#### Some nerd stats about me

Joined Github **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years ago.

Since then I pushed **{{ COMMITS }}** commits, opened **{{ ISSUES }}** issues, submitted **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests, received **{{ STARS }}** stars across **{{ REPOSITORIES }}** personal projects and contributed to **{{ REPOSITORIES_CONTRIBUTED_TO }}** public repositories.

Most of the time I'm creating software in these languages:

{{ LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_START:max=10 }}
